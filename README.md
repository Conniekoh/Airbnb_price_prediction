# Steps
Evaluated based on RMSE (root mean squared error) score. Lower the RMSE score, better the model.
1. Install library packages 
2. Read a dataset of 41,739 observations and 97 variables
3. Data Wrangling. Improved data quality by changing data structure and transforming variables, including missing data imputation, factorâ€™s levels redefinition, training and testing dataset separation
4. Select significant variables using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature selection including lasso and Principal Components Regression (PCA)
5. Trained supervised machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Ranger, tuneRanger, and XGBoost; tuneRanger had the lowest RMSE score of 288.63
